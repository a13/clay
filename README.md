# Clay

![Clay logo](resources/Clay.svg)

Clay is a small Clojure tool for a dynamic workflow of data visualization and literate programming.


## Getting Started
Add Clay to your project dependencies:

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.scicloj/clay.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.scicloj/clay)

(If you like to use [aliases](https://practical.li/blog-staging/posts/clojure-cli-tools-understanding-aliases/), you may add it to the extra dependencies under an alias. See, for example, the [deps.edn](https://github.com/scicloj/noj/blob/main/deps.edn) file of [Noj](https://github.com/scicloj/noj).)

To render a given Clojure namespace, say `"notebooks/index.clj"`, you may run the following in the REPL:
```clj
(require '[scicloj.clay.v2.api :as clay])
(clay/make! {:source-path "notebooks/index.clj"})
```
This will render an HTML page and serve it in Clay's browser view.
Note that Clay does not need to be mentioned in the namespace itself.

More details may be found in the [Documentation](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/). In particular:
* See the [API](https://scicloj.github.io/clay#api) and [Configuration](https://scicloj.github.io/clay#configuration) subsections for more options and variations.
* See the [Setup](https://scicloj.github.io/clay#setup) section and recent [Videos](https://scicloj.github.io/clay#videos) for details about integrating Clay with your editor so you do not need to call `make!` yourself.

## Related projects

The [Claykind](https://github.com/timothypratley/claykind) project is rethinking the Clay architecture and implementation from scratch, in a new code base. Currently (Fall 2023), the two projects are being developed in coordination.

[Kindly](https://github.com/scicloj/kindly) is a common ground for defining how things should be visualized, seeking compatibility across tools.

[kindly-advice](https://github.com/scicloj/kindly-advice) is a library that helps tools such as Clay to be Kindly-compatible.

[read-kinds](https://github.com/scicloj/read-kinds) is used internally by Claykind (and soon by Clay as well) to generate Kindly advice from notebooks expressed as Clojure namespaces.
