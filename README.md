# Clay

![Clay logo](resources/Clay.svg)


Clay is a small Clojure tool for a dynamic workflow of data visualization and literate programming.

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/org.scicloj/clay.svg)](https://clojars.org/org.scicloj/clay)

## Usage

Add [org.scicloj/clay](https://clojars.org/org.scicloj/clay) as a dependency. 
  * (If you are building a library and using Clay to document it, probably you do not need Clay to be a dependency of the library, but only of your dev environment, so you may define it as an extra dependency in a Deps alias. See, for example, the [deps.edn](https://github.com/scicloj/noj/blob/main/deps.edn) file of [Noj](https://github.com/scicloj/noj).)

Setup and usage can be found in the [Documentation](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/).

Regular updates are given at the [visual-tools meetings](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/visual-tools/).

## Related projects

The [Claykind](https://github.com/timothypratley/claykind) project is rethinking the Clay architecture and implementation from scratch, in a new code base. Currently (Fall 2023), the two projects are being developed in coordination.

[Kindly](https://github.com/scicloj/kindly) is a common ground for defining how things should be visualized, seeking compatibility across tools.

[kindly-advice](https://github.com/scicloj/kindly-advice) is a library that helps tools such as Clay to be Kindly-compatible.

[read-kinds](https://github.com/scicloj/read-kinds) is used internally by Claykind (and soon by Clay as well) to generate Kindly advice from notebooks expressed as Clojure namespaces.
