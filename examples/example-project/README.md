# Clay example project

If you start your REPL in this project, the commands at the [`user` namespace](src/user.clj) will setup and start Clay properly.

Then, you can use the [`example1` namespace] as a notebook from your editor  -- see the recommended setup and commands in the [Setup](https://scicloj.github.io/clay/#setup) section of the Clay tutorial.
